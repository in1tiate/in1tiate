I'm in1tiate (init for short), a freelance software engineer.

My current projects are:
- the Attorney Online project and associated software
- a more complete set of documentation for WrightScript, a visual novel display scriptlang similar to renpy
- a few âœ¨secretâœ¨ projects
- whatever else suits my fancy
